*Executive Summary

Problem: Common gym-goers struggle to plan workouts because occupancy peaks make equipment unavailable.

Solution: Gym Occupancy Predictor ingests historical check-in data, exposes a FastAPI service that returns expected crowd sizes per hour, and pairs it with a Vite/React frontend so students instantly see “low/medium/high” crowd bands and pick quieter times. 

*System Overview

Course Concept(s): 

Case 4-5: Flask, JSON, and APIs

Architecture Diagram: Include a PNG in /assets and embed it here.
Data/Models/Services: List sources, sizes, formats, and licenses.

3) How to Run (Local)
Choose Docker or Apptainer and provide a single command. Example:
Docker
4) Design Decisions
Why this concept? Alternatives considered and why not chosen.
Tradeoffs: Performance, cost, complexity, maintainability.
Security/Privacy: Secrets mgmt, input validation, PII handling.
Ops: Logs/metrics, scaling considerations, known limitations.
5) Results & Evaluation
Screenshots or sample outputs (place assets in /assets).
Brief performance notes or resource footprint (if relevant).
Validation/tests performed and outcomes.
6) What’s Next
Planned improvements, refactors, and stretch features.
7) Links (Required)

Public Cloud App (optional): <INSERT-CLOUD-URL>
Milestones (Suggested, not graded separately)
• M1: One–paragraph pitch + target module concept + rough architecture sketch.
• M2: Prototype runs locally; container builds; core feature works.
• M3: Polish docs, tests, diagrams; optional cloud deploy.
Academic Integrity. Follow all course policies. If using external code/data/models, cite
clearly and respect licenses.
