Case–Study Write–Up Template (place in README.md)
1) Executive Summary
Problem: What problem are you solving, and for whom?
Solution: One paragraph, non–technical overview of your project.
2) System Overview
Course Concept(s): Name the specific module concept/tool you used.
Architecture Diagram: Include a PNG in /assets and embed it here.
Data/Models/Services: List sources, sizes, formats, and licenses.
3) How to Run (Local)
Choose Docker or Apptainer and provide a single command. Example:
Docker
4) Design Decisions
Why this concept? Alternatives considered and why not chosen.
Tradeoffs: Performance, cost, complexity, maintainability.
Security/Privacy: Secrets mgmt, input validation, PII handling.
Ops: Logs/metrics, scaling considerations, known limitations.
5) Results & Evaluation
Screenshots or sample outputs (place assets in /assets).
Brief performance notes or resource footprint (if relevant).
Validation/tests performed and outcomes.
6) What’s Next
Planned improvements, refactors, and stretch features.
7) Links (Required)
GitHub Repo: <INSERT-REPO-URL>
Public Cloud App (optional): <INSERT-CLOUD-URL>
Milestones (Suggested, not graded separately)
• M1: One–paragraph pitch + target module concept + rough architecture sketch.
• M2: Prototype runs locally; container builds; core feature works.
• M3: Polish docs, tests, diagrams; optional cloud deploy.
Academic Integrity. Follow all course policies. If using external code/data/models, cite
clearly and respect licenses.
